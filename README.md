# Destruction-of-Steganography
Steps to run the code: <br>
1. Download the pretrained weights and the input image. <br>
2. Download the .ipynb code files and open it on preferred python ide.<br>
3. Run the image convert code to resize the input image to low resolution.<br>
4. Run the lsb stego code and choose encode (1) option. Give the low resolution image as input. Enter secret message to be encoded along with image path.<br>
5. Give the secret image as input to the edsr code and obtain a super resolution image.<br>
6. Run the lsb stego code again and choose decode (2) option. <br>
7. Obtain the output file and check for secret message. It will be removed.
